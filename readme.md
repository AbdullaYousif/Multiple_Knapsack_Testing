COMBINATORIAL TESTING

In terms of input parameters, the key variables that influence the programs behavior are:

weights: A vector which contains the weights of the items
values: A vector which contains the values of the items
capacities (knapsacks): A vector containing the capacities of all the bins
number of items
number of knapsacks
capacity constraints
weight-value correlation
